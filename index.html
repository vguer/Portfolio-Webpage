She studied Human Development and Psychology at the University of California, Davis, and has extensive experience advocating for and supporting vulnerable populations. At home, Vanessa gets lost behind pages and screens- reading, drawing, inspired by all the beautiful things. She enrolled in Epicodus to pursue the <em>satisfaction</em> in solving problems with creative solutions.</p>
